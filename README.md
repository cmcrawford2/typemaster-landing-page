## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that in order to put an orange overlay on an image, you don't have to do anything in css or html. I could simply go to figma and put an orange rectangle on the image, set it to multiply, and export it as .jpg. Then I substituted the orange picture for the black and white one in assets.

### Continued development

I'm not sure my solutions were the best. I would like to learn more about grid and flex, in particular, how they work.
